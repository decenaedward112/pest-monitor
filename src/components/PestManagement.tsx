          <p>1. Remove and properly dispose stubbles and/or flood the field.</p>
          <p>2. Avoid close planting and continuous stagnant water.</p>
          <p>
            3. Do not use pesticides: Earlier studies reveal that yields were
            not significantly impacted even if DH incidence were up to 31%. This
            is because crops in the vegetative stage compensate for the damage
            by producing more tillers.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Pull out damaged shoots by hand: If it does not come out easily,
            it might be caused by other pests like the Rice Black Bug.

            1. Handpick and destroy egg masses but keep some eggs in a jar in
            order to determine hatching and time for insecticide application.
          </p>
          <p>2. Clip the tip of the seedlings to reduce egg masses.</p>
          <p>
            3. Raise the water level of irrigation periodically in order to
            flood egg masses deposited in the lower parts of the crop.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Avoid using pesticides: Given that eggs are protected with a
            protective shell made up of female YSB mat hair, pesticides and
            other chemicals only cause minimal damage.

            1. Make use of systemic pesticides like Chlorantranilipore 12.5% SC
            at 0.3 mL per liter of water (60mL per acre).
          </p>
          <p>2. Try trapping methods like light traps and pheromone traps.</p>
          <p>
            3. Encourage growth in numbers of biological control agents like
            parasitoids through the use of egg parasitization.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. Use recommended pesticides: The Economic Threshold Level (ETL)
            for managing Yellow Stem Borer (YSB) involves treating crops when
            there are 2 egg masses/mÂ² or 10% dead heart, using insecticides like
            Quinalphos 25 EC (100 mL/ha), Phosphamidon 40 SL (600 mL/ha), or
            Profenophos 50 EC (1000 mL/ha). Newly hatched larvae require two
            applications of either Quinalphos or Phosphamidon at 1000 mL/ha,
            spaced 7 days apart.

            2. Apply recommended insecticides if pest populations are high,
